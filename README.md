# betomat-plugin-ckeditor5

This plugin provides users with tools for analysis of language style of edited text.

Currently it allows for highlighting of arbitrary groups of words that you need to provide to it first. The goal of this feature is to help users find overused grammatical constructs.

If you are interested in better README with some examples, let me know in the issue queue. It will motivate me to improve it :) .
